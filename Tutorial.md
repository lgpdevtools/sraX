# sraX User Guide: real data examples

## 1) User-provided data for AMR DB compilation
### Public ARG sequences repositories:
A recently published work [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty987) describes a toolkit ([[ARGDIT]](https://github.com/phglab/ARGDIT)) for creating curated AMR DBs. They provide integrated AMR DBs as examples and this information is going to be employed for the utility of sraX.

### User's own ARG sequences:

## 2) Genome data acquisition from already analyzed collections  
### Data-set 1: 

### Data-set 2:
